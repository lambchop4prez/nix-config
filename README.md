# Nix Config

This repository contains [nix](https://nixos.org/) configs.

Initial plan

 - [x] Create initial [`nix-darwin`](https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin) config for multiple macs
 - [ ] Create a linux config to allow for a consistent experience across platforms
 - [x] Setup [`home-manager`](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager) to eventually replace my [`.dotfiles`](https://github.com/lambchop4prez/dotfiles)

> [!NOTE]
> This is a learning exercise and likely has shortcomings.
